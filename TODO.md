- fix the pollution, pollution is "bright green" (=good) right on industrial zone tile, this is wrong.
- make the logic less "twitchy", all zones keep being abandoned/built too quickly
- have tests for core logic
- The default tile value should be neutral. An industrial tile detracts from land value. Pollution too. The dropoff should be less "steep" for positive/negative values.
- desirability and efficiency show in blue in the info pane unlike the other fields

- Genrate a map based on a seed I can reuse; seed=true should show a seed and I should be able to put it somewhere seed=VALUE
- Web Workers - Offload heavy calculations to background threads
- Request Animation Frame - Use this for smooth animation timing
- Layered canvases (background / static props / dynamic props / UI)	Static layers redraw only when they change, so the game loop touches far fewer pixels
- Dirty‑rect (partial) repainting	Only clear & redraw tiles that moved since the last frame – huge win for grid games
