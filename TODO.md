- efficiency show in blue in the info pane unlike the other fields
- do not show preview of a tile if we are hovering over a mountain
- do not place initial road by city hall, it has a carry cost so we start losing money straight away
- the overlay (tile value, polution) need to render correctly when showing over a hilly terrain. The "wall" facing me is notpainted with the overlay color.
- zone tiles need to show the same wall caolor even for the "block" that's under ground. E.g. when a business is strugglign and we give it a darker shade, I need to see this darker shade underground as well.

- Genrate a map based on a seed I can reuse; seed=true should show a seed and I should be able to put it somewhere seed=VALUE
- Web Workers - Offload heavy calculations to background threads
- Request Animation Frame - Use this for smooth animation timing
- Layered canvases (background / static props / dynamic props / UI)	Static layers redraw only when they change, so the game loop touches far fewer pixels
- Dirty‑rect (partial) repainting	Only clear & redraw tiles that moved since the last frame – huge win for grid games
